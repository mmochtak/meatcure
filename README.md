# meatcure
Meatcure is a data repository for collecting sensory data from the curing chamber I built during the COVID lockdown. The curing chamber is monitored with a Raspberry Pi Pico W, which is hooked up with a DHT22 sensor and various peripherals for controlling temperature (a hot-wired Wi-Fi socket), air flow (mini fan), and humidity (cold mist humidifier and hot-wired dehumidifier). The Pico W sends data to a local server I run on another Raspberry Pi 3. The Raspberry Pi then pushes the data every five minutes to this GitHub repository. The data is then used for an online monitoring app I host on shinyapps.io - https://mochtak.shinyapps.io/meatcure/.
